# Open Circuit Benchmark (OCB) Dataset

This directory contains the **Open Circuit Benchmark (OCB)** dataset, used as the experimental foundation for CktGen.

## 🔗 Appreciation & Source

The OCB dataset was introduced by the authors of **CktGNN** ([Dong et al., 2023](https://github.com/zehao-dong/CktGNN)). Their work established a crucial standard for cataloging and benchmarking analog circuits. We are honored to build upon this high-quality foundation.
